			<h1>Start HERE</h1>
			<p>Calculingua is a web application for mathematical analysis
				and design. Therefore the dominant interface elements have been
				developed to allow rapid analysis. The major elements are:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Command Entry Bar -- Down there at the bottom. The
					Command Entry Bar is where you type your math commands.</li>
				<li>Sidebar -- Over on the left. It shows various data
					items based on what you pick from the menu bar on the left. It
					defaults to a variable viewer that allows you to see what
					variables are in your workspace.</li>
				<li>History Window -- That's were you're reading this. It's
					where you see the results of your math show up.</li>
				<li>Top Bar -- Right above here. It has icons for things
					like modifying your account and logging out.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Math!</h2>
			<p>Calculingua is designed for math, so let's see how to do
				it:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Let's say we want to add two numbers -- 2 and 5. To do
					that, type the following code in the the Command Entry Bar and
					hit enter: <br> <code> 2 + 5 </code> <br> You should
					see see that command be pushed to the History Window, followed
					by the answer. Note that without assigning this math to a
					variable, Calculingua assumes that you want the variable "ans"
					to equal this. Therefore, the variable "ans" now has the value
					7.
				</li>
				<li>Okay, so what you really wanted was for the variable
					"my_variable" to equal 7. To achieve that, type the following
					and hit enter:<br> <code>my_variable = 5 + 2</code>
				<li>Then let's say you want to do something with your new
					viable... Type the following and hit enter to set
					"my_other_variable" to 716:<br> <code>my_other_variable
						= 100 * my_variable + (20 - 4)</code>
				</li>
				<li>This is just the most basic example. Calculingua is
					really much more than a simple five function calculator -- it's
					designed to perform matrix mathematics. We'll not get into that
					here, but to learn about the rest of the functions of
					Calculingua, type the following followed by enter:<br> <code>help</code>
				</li>
			</ol>
